## Project resume 📑
This is an API for a **delivery tracking system** with 2 different types of users - *customer* and *carrier*.

### The customer side 📦
A user can register as a customer, place an order, see a list of all of their orders, and track individual orders. They can also view, edit and delete their account.

### The carrier side 🚚
Carriers are pre-registered into the database, as the program is supposed to be more customer-oriented. Carriers' main purpose is to update the customers' orders. There is a set amount of statuses for the orders like Accepted, Denied, Awaiting delivery, etc.
